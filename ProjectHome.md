## How to check out some code ##
Simply enter the repository URL into your favourite SVN client:

`http://malaka.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/[prolog|java|xml]/`

## How to commit to the repository ##
To commit files you need to authenticate against the Subversion server.

This is _only_ possible, if you are accessing the repository via a secure connection (https)!

See http://code.google.com/p/malaka/source for example.

## Authentication ##
To authenticate use your Google user name, of course.
You will find a generated password in your [settings](http://code.google.com/hosting/settings)

## Repo path ##
As repository path use `https://malaka.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/[java|xml]/` in your favourite SVN client.
